What I Need to Do 

- the first thing you need to do is get a list of hosts from /get-hosts 
    - use mockjax / $.ajax() jquery to get that list 


- When click the dropdown button, an overlay modal appears
    - that overlay will have a search bar, sort parameters, and a list of existing hosts 
        - sort parameters: alphabetical, reverse-alphabetical, select all, deselect all 
        - search bar needs to filter the hosts dynamically 
 
- if you click "add a random host", it will add a new option to the dropdown


- after the hosts are clicked, console.log the list of selected hosts
